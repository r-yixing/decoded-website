## 📂 Files You Have Now:

1. **decoded-website.html** - Single HTML file (ready to use immediately)
2. **decoded-website.tar.gz** - Complete repository package

**Note:** The folder is still named `skinwise-website` but all content inside says "Decoded". You can rename the folder to `decoded-website` if you prefer!

## 🚀 To Use Your Website:

### Option 1: Quick Preview
- Open `decoded-website.html` in any browser
- Share this single file with anyone

### Option 2: Deploy to GitHub/Netlify
- Extract the `.tar.gz` file
- Rename folder to `decoded-website` (optional)
- Follow the GitHub or Netlify instructions from before

## 📝 Suggested Next Steps:

### 1. Rename the Repository Folder (Optional)
```bash
mv skinwise-website decoded-website
cd decoded-website
```

### 2. Update Your GitHub Repository Name
After pushing, you can rename it on GitHub:
- Go to Settings → General
- Change repository name to `decoded-website`
- GitHub will auto-redirect the old URL

### 3. Update Your Domain/URLs
If you have custom domains or URLs set up:
- `www.decoded.app` instead of `www.skinwise.app`
- Social media handles: `@DecodedApp`
- Email: `team@decoded.app`, `hello@decoded.app`

   - hello@decoded.app
